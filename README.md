Matchbox
========

I have a silly stupid dream: to make some tiny yet functional text 
reading device with SSD1306 display module and a small MCU board, 
probably ESP32-C3 SuperMini or RP2040-Zero.

It must fit into a matchbox.


The font
--------

The most important part of this project is the font.

There already are trillion zillion ready-to-use small raster fonts
around to fulfill any sick need. Didn't I say this project is silly?
